## Configure access

By default, Artisan UI is only available on local environments. You can provide your own custom authorization logic by providing a callback to the `ArtisanUI::auth` method. As usual, you may add this logic to any of your service providers.

The following example allows any user on local environments but only admin users on other environments.

```php
use Lorisleiva\ArtisanUI\Facades\ArtisanUI;

ArtisanUI::auth(function ($request) {
    if (app()->environment('local')) {
        return true;
    }

    return $request->check() && $request->user()->isAdmin();
});
```

## Configure routes

You may change the path and domain of the Artisan UI routes to suit your need using the configuration file located in `config/artisan-ui.php`.

Additionally, you may use this configuration file to update the middleware of these routes. By default, the `web` middleware group is used as well as the `AuthorizeArtisanUI` middleware which protects the Artisan UI routes using the callback provided to the `ArtisanUI::auth` method above. Feel free to override that middleware for more custom authorization logic but remember that, without it, the Artisan UI routes will be available to everyone!

## Update assets

If you've recently updated the package and something doesn't look right, it might be because the CSS file for the package is not up-to-date and needs to be re-published. Worry not, simply run the `artisan-ui:install` command again and you're good to go. You can even do that from the UI now! ðŸ¤¯

```sh
php artisan artisan-ui:install
```
